   * This methods tries to find "nice" values between from/to, so that the amount of ticks

   *
   *
   * ## How this algorithm works
   *
   * ### Step 1: Calculate the minimum distance between two ticks
   * Depending on the delta of the value range and the max ticks, we calculate the minimum distance
   * between ticks.
   * The returned distance between ticks may be larger than this value (then there will be fewer ticks
   * than [maxTickCount]. But never smaller (then there would be *more* ticks than [maxTickCount]).
   *
   * ### Step 2: Find a value larger (or same) as minTickDistance that is a power of 10
   * We want the ticks to be on nice/round values. Therefore we use log10 and power to get a value that is a power of 10.
   *
   * #### Larger/smaller
   * In most cases we look for a value that is larger than minTickDistance because minTickDistance is not a power of 10. --> greater is used
   * If minTickDistance is a power of 10, smaller is used
   *
   * ### Step 3: Optimize ticks
   * To improve the ticks, we check if we can apply some factors to get additional ticks.
