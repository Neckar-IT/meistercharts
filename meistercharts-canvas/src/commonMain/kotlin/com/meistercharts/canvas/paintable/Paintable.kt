/**
 * A paintable paints itself on a canvas. It can be an image, a set of paint instructions or something else.
 *
 * A paintable paints itself relative to the given location.
 * The paintable decides itself in which direction to the given location it is painted.
 *
 * The bounding box of the paintable can be used to layout a paintable (e.g. when aligning paintables in a toolbar or legend)
 * The method [paintInBoundingBox] uses this information to align a paintable.
 *
 * A paintable can paint in all directions - relative to the start location.
 *
 * There are two types methods:
 *
 * * [paint]: The paintable paints itself at the given location.
 * * [paintInBoundingBox]: The paintable is painted at the given location using the anchor - depending on the bounding box. Useful for legend/toolbars
 *
 * ATTENTION: There is also the interface [ResizablePaintable] which allows the user of the [Paintable] to change its size.

interface Paintable {
  /**
   * Returns the bounding box of a paintable.
   * The bounding box contains the *visual* content of a paintable.
   * It is possible that a paintable paints smaller details *outside* the bounding box (e.g. labels)
   *
   *
   * The bounding box can cover any area.
   * The alignment point (this is the point where the paintable is aligned to) may be inside or outside the bounding box.
   * The x/y coordinate of the bounding box represents the "translation" from the alignment point to the upper left corner of the bounding box (that has happened already).
   * Therefore, negative x/y values represent a translation to the upper left or put differently: the alignment point lies to the right and bottom from the upper left corner of the bounding box.
   *
   * # Example with the alignment point inside bounding box
   * ```
   * ----------------------
   * |                    |
   * |                    |
   * |       * (a. point) |
   * |                    |
   * ----------------------
   * ```
   *
   * Suppose that bounding box has a width of 150 px and a height of 75 px.
   * Since the upper left corner of the bounding box is to the left and to the top of the alignment point x/y of the bounding box are negative, e.g. : -60/-50
   *
   * # Example with the alignment point outside bounding box
   * ```
   * ----------------------
   * |                    |
   * |                    |
   * |                    |
   * |                    |
   * ----------------------
   *
   *           * (alignment point)
   * ```
   *
   * Suppose that bounding box has a width of 150 px and a height of 75 px.
   * The upper left corner of the bounding box would be: -75/-100
   *
   * # Alignment Point
   * The x/y coordinates of the bounding box describe where the alignment point is located:
   * * x/y = 0/0: the alignment point coincides with the upper left corner of the bounding box
   * * x/y = -width/-height: the alignment point coincides with the lower right corner of the bounding box
