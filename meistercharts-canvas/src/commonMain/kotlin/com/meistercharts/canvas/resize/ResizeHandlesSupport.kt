/**
 * The model that holds the resizable object information.
 *
 * The values are rendered and handled by the [ResizeByHandlesLayer]
 *
 * ATTENTION: This implementation does only support *ONE* resizable content at a time.
 * Therefore if multiple resizable contents are registered, only the latest one is processed.
 *
 * Each layer may register a [ResizeHandler]. The layer is only notified about resize events for its
 * resizable.
 *
 * Hot it works:
 * 1. a handler that recognizes resize-events (typically a [ResizeByHandlesLayer])
 * calls [notifyResize] every time it detects a resize
 * 2. a [Layer] with potentially resizable content passes itself and a [ResizeHandler] to [onResize].
 * That handler resizes the content when it gets notified about a resize event.
 * 3. the [Layer] passes itself and the current bounds of the resizable content to [setResizable]
 * everytime its layout-function is called.
 * 4. the [Layer] calls [clear] when its content is no longer resizable.
