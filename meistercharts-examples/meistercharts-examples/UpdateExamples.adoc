= Update Example Projects

== Update Dependencies in the Monorepo

The root directory of the example projects contains a shell script
``updateDependencies.sh``. This script iterates over all projects and updates them.

=== updating

If a newer version of a major or minor version is available you can run
the following command:

```shell
./updateDependencies.sh
```

you can also run the gradle task:
```
./gradlew meisterchartsDemosUpgrade
```
or
```
./gradlew internal:open:meistercharts:examples:meisterchartsDemosUpgrade
```

This Script is updating the ``package-lock.json`` of npm projects and
``yarn.lock`` files of yarn projects.

=== updating meistercharts-minimal
The ``meistercharts-minimal`` project have to be updated **manually** because it is
a blank HTML project and can't be updated by the script.
